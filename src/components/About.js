          Previously working in marketing and social work, I decided to take the
          plunge into the field of web development in Jan 2021. I had been eager
          to make the career pivot and am so glad I finally did. I always felt I had a creative mind, but never knew what my outlet for my creativity was, until I found web development. I could not be happier. I find great joy in building aesthetically pleasing web applications. Additionally, throughout my entire adult life I have been committed to advocating for advancements and equality in women's healthcare.

        <p>Originally from Connecticut, I moved to Vermont in 2009 attending Champlain College. After college, I left and have spent time living in Massachusetts and Connecticut, but ultimately always end up back in Vermont. I now own a home in Northern Vermont with beautiful views of Mt. Mansfield, and plenty of room for my dogs to roam. Life is good! </p>

          When the world is not in a pandemic, I love to travel. I spend as much
          time as I can outside, with my family and two dogs: Rex (a 13 yr old
          rescue) and Ranger (one year old Border Collie). We love to snowboard,
          hike, go camping, and hang by the river in the summer.

          I love exploring new places and cultures, and am always excited to
          visit a new museum. Often I can be found lost in a good book with my
          head in the clouds.
